<h1>String Naming and Standard Tuning</h1>
<img src="./imgs/t20.jpg">
<h5>Strings are numbered from the thinnest string (1st string) to the thickest string (6th string).<br>The tuning is given from the 6th string to the 1st string: E-A-D-G-B-E.<br>This tuning (E-A-D-G-B-E) is called standard tuning.</h5>

<br>
<h4>1. Fret the fifth fret of the sixth string, the Low E String (pictured).  Play the fifth and sixth string.  Match the pitch of the fifth string to the pitch of the sixth string. Listen for a beating or pulsating between the two strings. The faster the beating, the more out of tune it is. Adjust the A string until there is virtually no beating.
