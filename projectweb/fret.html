 <h1>Why You Should Learn the Fretboard</h1>
 <h4>You should learn the fretboard for one simple reason.   You want to play faster!

Usually, when people talk about speed, they talk about the physical aspects of learning the guitar.  Usually, I think of shredders finger tapping their way to insane flurries of notes.  Shredding takes a lot of practice, but it is a different type of speed.

When you learn the fretboard, you play faster because you can instantly recall a note.  Instant recall allows you to find and play any note as fast as possible.  It is a mental speed, which allows you to decide, find, and play faster.

<h1>Why Deriving the Fretboard Doesn’t Work</h1>
 <h4>Most guitarists claim to know the fretboard because they can find any note.  Many songs have a tempo of 120bpm, which is 2 seconds per measure.
 You need to recall notes in fractions of a second!  This is why knowing how to find any note does not work.  Without instant recall, you cannot keep up!

 <h1>How to Learn the Fretboard</h1>
 <h4>Learning the fretboard is not hard, but it takes practice.  Most guitarists find the task boring because they learn it the wrong way.  On top of that they try to take shortcuts that don’t work!  The best way to learn the fretboard is by incorporating multiple ways of remembering the note.  This is not only more interesting, it is more effective

 <h1>Use Associations</h1>
 <h4>The human brain remembers by using associations.  When you play a note, you think of the note you want.  You find it on the fretboard.  You hear the note.  You see the fretboard.  All these items can be associated with each other to form multi-dimensional exercises.  Later, I will give you exercises that associate what you see, hear, and feel to maximize your efficiency.

 <h1>Fret Numbering</h1>
 <h4>Frets are numbered from the headstock toward the body starting with 1. Sometimes the number 0 or letter O is used to denote an open string, or one that is played without fretting a note.

Fretting a note is executed by pressing the string down behind a fret (on the headstock side of the fret).
